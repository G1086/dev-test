				<h2>The Benefits of CommunityLiving</h2>
				<p>Studies have shown that 90% of time at home is spent occupying less than 40% of the space. It just doesnʼt make sense. Why not leverage all that unused space in a combined and efficient way for the of benefit of a whole community? That increased shared space also offers added benefits in providing just a few of this impressive range of features.</p>
